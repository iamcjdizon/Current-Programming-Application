#Current-Programming-Application

This repository consists of the activities and projects that was made in our current programming application class. The programming application used is Python.

Hours, Minutes, Seconds
	- Write a program a program to convert an input number of seconds (integer) into hours, minutes, and seconds. Output the result.

4 and 7
	- Print all the numbers between 1 and n(inclusive) that are both divisible 4 and multiple of 7. N is user input.

Products of Digits
	- Ask the user to input a postive integer. Compute then print the product of its digits.

Fibonacci
	- Ask the user to input a number then print all Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to that number.

Append
	- Create an empty list. Continously ask the user for a value, then using list.append() add the user input to the list until the user enerted "exit". Finally, print the resulting list.

Ingly
	- Ask the user to input a string. If its length is atleast 3, add 'ing' to it. However, if it already ends in 'ing', add 'ly' instead. If the string length is less than three, leave it unchanged. Continue doing this until the user entered 'stop'. Note: Use str.endswith(sub) function.

Unite Union
	- Write a function that takes one or more arrays and returns a new array of unique values in the order of the original provided arrays.
	- In other words, all values present from all arrays should be included in their original order, but with no duplicates in the final array.
	- The unique numbmers should be sorted by their original order, (the final array should not be sourted in numberical order)

Reverse Complement
	- In genetic the reverse compliment of a sequence is formed by reversing the sequence and then taking the compliment of each symbol. The four nucleotides in DNA is Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine(G), and Thymine (T). This a bidirectional relation.
		A is complement ot T. T is a complement of A. C is a complement of G. G is a complement of C.
	- For this exercise you need to complete the reverse complement function that takes a DNA string and returns the reverse complement.
	- Note: You need to take care of lower and upper case. And if a sequence contains some invalid characters you need to return 'Invalid sequence'. You can use str[::-1] to reverse the string.
